## How it works?

This proyect allow you to consume the data exposed [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data). So you will be able to consult the differents food trucks, what they offer and were are located. 

## The Challenge

As the song says, "you've got to play the hand you're dealt", and in this case your hand is to implement something to help us manage our food truck habit.

Our team loves to eat. They are also a team that loves variety, so they also like to discover new places to eat.

In fact, we have a particular affection for food trucks. One of the great things about Food Trucks in San Francisco is that the city releases a list of them as open data.

Your assignment is to make it possible for our teams to do something interesting with this food trucks data.

This is a freeform assignment. You can write a web API that returns a set of food trucks. You can write a web frontend that visualizes the nearby food trucks for a given place. You can create a CLI that lets us get the names of all the taco trucks in the city. You can create system that spits out a container with a placeholder webpage featuring the name of each food truck to help their marketing efforts. You're not limited by these ideas at all, but hopefully those are enough help spark your own creativity.
San Francisco's food truck open dataset is [located here](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data) and there is an endpoint with a [CSV dump of the latest data here](https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/rqzj-sfat/rows.csv). We've also included a copy of the data in this repo as well.
